# Financial Analyst
Financial Analyst is a demonstration of how to use the `FoundationModels` framework to generate streaming content from external APIs as the tokens are generated - in this case using the Perplexity API, but this can easily be applied to Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. 

## Setup
1. This project was created in Xcode Beta 4 - so macOS Tahoe / iOS 26 are required
2. Add your Perplexity API key in `PerplexityClient`
